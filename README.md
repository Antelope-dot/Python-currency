# Python-currency
A working currency converter that can be run from the terminal

To use the program all you have to do is type currency.py at the folder you have downloaded the program (or just copy the program to your bin so you can use it anywhere) 

First you will be asked to Select your currency from 33 choices.  Select a number form 1-33. Next you will be asked for an amount of your current currency wich can be any natural number. Lastly you will be asked to select the currency you want to convert to. After this the program will print to the terminal your amount of currency in the desired currency.
